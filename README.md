# Image Resizer
Image Resizer created by me in Python

This image resizer is not perfect.
I just started learning python and this is one of few beginner projects i made.

To use it you need to install the Pillow package ->
Enter "pip install Pillow" in your command prompt

Feel free to add some own code to my image resizer or maybe add some new features to it.
You can send me your image resizer everytime on discord "maleh#7415"

This is a preview of the image resizer
